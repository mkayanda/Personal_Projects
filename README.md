# Personal_Projects

This repository contains a mix of my personal study files that I push here to keep tabs with what I'm learning through my data science journey. They range in topics. I hope it interests you and feel free to contribute please.


In the pandas notebooks some of the areas I cover are:

1) simple data analysis and explorations e.g. reading datasets, checking statistical information and so forth.
2) advanced pandas operations e.g. groupby, nlargest and nsmallest, sorting and dropping duplicates.
